## A/B Testing
### Project Report by Ashutosh Singh
-------------------------------------

#### Experiment
In this experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked
"start free trial", they were asked how much time they had available to
devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week,
they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they
indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear
indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time
commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student
might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the
student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or
access the course materials for free instead.

#### Metric Selection

**Number of Cookies** -  *INVARIANT* This metric will not change with the experiment as the
number of users visiting Udacity will not change as they have been not yet part
of the experiment.

**Number of user-ids** - *NONE* This will not be an invariant metric because the
number of enrolled users may depend on the rendered page and we may see different
values in the groups. This metric can be an evaluation metric but it is just a
number and Gross Conversion does a better job at counting the number of users and
also the affect of the *5 hour commitment question*.

**Number of click** - *INVARIANT* Same argument as the number of cookies. The
experiment has still not started so this metric will be invariant.

**Click-through-probability** - *INVARIANT* The user has still not seen the
experiment so this will not be different in the control and experiment groups.

**Gross conversion** - *EVALUATION* This is a metric we would like to evaluate.
It depends on how the page has rendered after clicking the START FREE TRIAL button.
We would like to know how showing a form with commitment questions changes the
enrollment. Based on the hypothesis this metric will be *lower* as the user likely
to drop after seeing the question will be filtered.

**Retention** - *EVALUATION* Same as in case of gross conversion. We would like to
find out if the users who see the *5 hours commitment* question have more or less
rate of remaining enrolled. This will become higher according to hypothesis as
the those who have enrolled would be less likely to drop and those who would have
dropped are already filtered.

**Net Conversion** - *EVALUATION* This metric is the ratio of Retention and
Gross-Conversion. It gives us the big picture idea of how many users clicked
the START FREE TRIAL button and how many remained. This metric should increase
Retention will increase and Gross conversion will decrease and the ratio will
increase.


#### Measuring Variability


##### Measuring Standard Deviation

|Evaluation Metric| Standard Deviation|
|------------------|------------------|
|Gross Conversion |   0.020230      |
|Retention        |	  0.05494		|
|Net Conversion |     0.0156   |



For Gross Conversion and Net Conversion the unit of analysis is same i.e., cookie.
Since the unit of diversion is also cookie hence the analytical estimate will
match the empirical standard deviation from the experiment.

For Net Retention the unit of diversion (cookie that clicked on the Start Free
Trial button) and the unit of analysis (the user-id of the person enrolled) are
 different. Hence the analytical estimate will be different from empirical
 standard deviation for Retention.


#### Sizing

##### Choosing Number of Samples given Power

To calculate the number of samples required for each setup. I used the
[Evan Miller's calcutor](http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html).
The values are calculated in the table below. alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.2 is
chosen.i9h

| Metric                | Baseline Conversion Rate | Dmin   | Page views | Total Page Views  |
| ------                | ----------- | -----  | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Gross Conversion Rate | 0.20625     | 0.01   | 25,835     | 645,875           |
| Retention             | 0.53        | 0.01   | 39,115     | 4,741,212         |
| Net Conversion        | 0.109135    | 0.0075 | 27413	     | 685,325          |

Total Number of pageviews Required (max of all) = 4,741,212


##### Duration vs. Exposure

The statistical significance level is chosen to *0.05*

**Calculating Duration**

Keeping retention rate as evaluation metric will make the experiment go
much longer(4.7 million page views will take approx. 4 months on full
site traffic). Hence I am dropping the retention rate as evaluation
metric and use only Gross Conversion Rate and Net Conversion. This makes
the total number of page views to **685,325**.

**Exposure**

The exposure of the experiment is based on the risk involved. Since for the
experiment only a small reminder is shown about the time commitment. There will
be no physical harm to the users. Also since no sensitive information is being
collected therefore a 100% exposure is safe.

For the number of page views per day (40000) and a 100% exposure, it would take
us around 18 days for the experiment.

I chose not to use the Bonferroni Correction because the two metrics Gross Conversion
and Net Conversion are highly correlated.

##### Experiment Analysis

###### Sanity Checks

For each metric which is chosen as invariant metric I perform the sanity
checks. Following table shows the process and values for this

####### Number of Cookies

|    Data | Values    |
|----------|----------|
| Control Group | 345543 |
| Experiment Group | 344660 |
|Standard Deviation | 0.0006018|
|Margin of Error| 0.0011796 |
|lower bound | 0.4988|
|upper bound | 0.5012 |
|observed value | 0.5006|

***The observed value is within the 95 %CI  hence this invariant
metric passes the sanity check.***


###### Number of clicks on "Start Free Trial"


|    Data | Values    |
| ----------|----------|
| Control Group | 28378 |
| Experiment Group | 28325 |
|Standard Deviation | 0.0021|
|Margin of Error| 0.0041 |
|lower bound | 0.4959|
|upper bound | 0.5041|
|observed value | 0.5005|

***The observed value is within the 95 %CI  hence this invariant
metric passes the sanity check.***


##### Click-through-probability on "start free trial"

|    Data | Values    |
|----------|----------|
|Control Value | 0.0821258 |
|Standard Deviation | *sqrt(0.5 * (1-0.0821258) / (344660))* = **0.000468**|
|Margin of Error| *1.96 *0.000468* = **0.00092** |
|lower bound | *0.0821258 - 0.00092* = **0.0812**|
|upper bound | *0.0821258 + 0.00092* = **0.0830** |
|observed value | 0.0821258 (given)|

***The observed value is within the 95 %CI  hence this invariant
metric passes the sanity check.***

----------------------------------------------------------------


#### Effect Size Tests

Since we are using Gross Conversion and Net conversion as the evaluation metrics
following are the confidence intervals for them.

|Metric | Lower bound |  Upper Bound | Statistical significance | Practical significance |  
|-------|-------------|--------------| -------------------------|-------------------------|
|Gross Conversion | -0.0291 | -0.0120|  Yes | Yes |
|Net Conversion   | -0.0016 | 0.0019  | No | No |

Statistical significance is determined if the confidence interval does not contain
0 and Practical significance is determined if the interval does not include
*d-min* of 0.01 as decided in experiment.

#### Sign Tests

I used the graphpad calculator for the Sign test (link in References).

1. **Gross Conversion**

   |Calculation |  Value |
   |------------|---------|
   |# of successes | 4    |
   |# of Trials    |23    |
   |Probability    | 0.5  |
   |p-value ( 2-tailed ) | 0.0026 |

 Since the p-value is less than the alpha value o 0.05, hence the difference is
 statistically significant .

2. **Net conversion**

 |Calculation |  Value |
 |------------|---------|
 |# of successes | 10    |
 |# of Trials    |23    |
 |Probability    | 0.5  |
 |p-value ( 2-tailed ) | 0.6776 |

 The p-value for Net conversion is greater than the alpha value of 0.05, hence
 this difference is not statistically significant.

#### Summary

 I have decided to not use Boneferroni Correction because our decision is based
 upon the **both** Gross Conversion and Net Conversion metrics. The hypothesis
 requires that both the effects be considered and we cannot go ahead with one
 metric alone. Hence Bonferroni correction will not be appropriate here. 


### Recommendation

The hypothesis of the experiment was

*... that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough timeâ€”**without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course**. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.*

The main points were

1. Reducing the number of frustrated students as they didn't have enough time
2. Without reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial.

Our gross conversion was statistically and practically significant but the Net-
conversion was not statistically significant which means the number of students
to continue past the free trial were not reduced at a practical level. This completes
the point 2.

In layman's terms we find that the test does not reduce the number of paid
students significantly which was the goal.

Based on this I recommend to adopt the changes of adding "5 or more hour" Recommendation.


### Follow up Experiment

To reduce the number of frustrated students I would create a follow up experiment
as follows.

1. A pre-orientation course to complete before enrolling in a Nanodegree course
instead of the free trial button.

#### Hypothesis
This course will give them the feel of enrolling in a Nanodegree and will ask
from them to complete in a set time of 7-14 days ( the current trial period ).

Even though the current trial period helps students in getting how to go
about the Nanodegree but the courses are big enough to get a sense of completion
to achieve during the trial period. Completing a course will give them more
confidence and energy to continue the streak and they can also evaluate themselves.
This course can be non-evaluation based where the students can just post their
small projects on the forum for other to critique on and thus not increase the
load on Udacity coaches.

For Udacity this will give us a quantified metric if the student can genuinely
invest more than 5 hours per week and may increase the conversion as the students
will be now oriented with the whole process of the Nanodegree.

**Initial Unit of diversion** Cookies - Once enrolled the progress can be
tracked from the enrolled id.

**Evaluation Metrics**
Based on the hypothesis there will be two evaluation metrics :

1. Gross-Conversion :  The conversion rate from the users who see the Button
to enrolled users in pre-orientation. This will help us to quantify does the Nanodegree experience
helps to increase the enrollment.
2. Net-Conversion  : The number of users who enrolled after taking the pre-orientation
course. This can be tracked by the User-ids who have enrolled in the pre-orientation
course and finally to the Nanodegree.
